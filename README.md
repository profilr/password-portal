# Profilr Password Portal

This repository contains the source code of an app which facilitates the resetting of a database master password by a non-technical user.
It provides a portal which performs a number of tasks upon form submission, including resetting the database password via SQL and redeploying the main webapp with a new database configuration, without requiring technical team members to be involved in the process.
This was created so that the students who administrate Profilr can hand over their database to school administrators to prevent any misuse of students's personal information.
